## Regex Components
A regex is considered a literal, so the pattern must be wrapped in slash characters (/).

### Anchors

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers set the limits of the string that your regex matches (or an individual section of the string). They frequently include the minimum and maximum number of characters that your regex is looking for.

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions
Anything inside a set of square brackets ([]) represents a range of characters that we want to match.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
